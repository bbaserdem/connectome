Phase 0 of the Connectome Project is focused on establishing the foundational environment and API contracts needed for all later development.
This phase is explicitly defined as “Environment, Docs, and API Design” and aims to eliminate ambiguity, ensure reproducibility,
and provide a bedrock for incremental, contract-driven feature delivery.

## Phase 0 Purpose and Outputs
- The core goal is to set up a **unified development environment** (using Nix)
supporting Python, Rust, and Go, and to establish clear documentation.
- All API and data contracts for both internal components
(like the daemon, watcher, and parser) and external consumers
(like REST interfaces, MCP, and visualization) must be drafted and documented at this stage.
- This phase also prepares **sample Neo4j configurations** for both local and CI environments,
ensuring seamless transitions into real code graph storage.

## Key Deliverables
- **Nix development environment** configuration, cross-platform (Linux/macOS),
capturing all required dependencies for code, tools, and CI.
- **Comprehensive architectural documentation**: system diagrams, component overviews,
API contract drafts (REST, IPC, project internals).
- **API/data contracts**: Stubs and schemas for all core message types (JSON over IPC),
REST endpoints, and graph data exchanged between system components.
- **Sample/initial Neo4j configs** for local/test (CI) environments, scripted for easy onboarding.
- **Onboarding scripts, templates, and basic CI** to automate developer setup and ensure every environment is reproducible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No ambiguity about **environment or technology stack**; everything needed for
dev or CI is described, automated, and tested.
- API and data model contracts are published and serve as the foundation
for all future dev/test work—**docs are definitive**.
- The project can be installed and run locally with sample data,
in a way consistent with future phases.
- Documentation is present from the outset and grows alongside the code.

## Continuous Activities
- Every component, API, and setup step created in this phase is accompanied
and validated with live documentation and—where applicable—basic
test coverage or CI integration for reproducibility.
